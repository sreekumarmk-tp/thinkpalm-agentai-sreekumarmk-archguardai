# 🏗️ Agentic Arch Reviewer
**"Beyond static analysis: An AI Agent that thinks like a Tech Lead."**

## 📝 Project Name & Problem Statement
**Project Name:** Agentic Architecture Reviewer (AAR)

**Problem Statement:**
Manual architectural reviews are time-consuming and prone to human oversight. Traditional static analysis tools (linters) find syntax bugs but cannot identify high-level design patterns (like Clean Architecture or BLoC) or suggest structural improvements. This project provides an autonomous AI Agent that navigates a codebase like a human engineer—reading file structures and selectively analyzing code to provide high-level architectural insights.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/arjunpkumar/flutter_base.git](https://github.com/arjunpkumar/flutter_base.git)
cd thinkpalm-agentai-archguardai-teambeta
```
## Set Up a Virtual Environment
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Packages
   pip install streamlit langchain-openai langgraph requests python-dotenv

4. Create your .env File
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here

5. Start the App
   streamlit run app.py

📸 Screenshots of Working Prototype
    A. User Configuration
    The sidebar allows the user to select the most capable reasoning model available on the OpenRouter free tier.
    
    B. The Agentic Reasoning Loop
    The agent first lists files, then identifies "hotspots" like pubspec.yaml or main.dart, and reads them iteratively.
    
    C. Generated Architectural Report
    A Markdown report identifying the project's structure (e.g., "Feature-first Flutter Architecture") and recommending improvements.

Demo Highlights:

Handling Rate Limits: Demonstrating switching to gpt-oss-120b when other models are saturated.

Autonomous Navigation: The agent deciding which files to read based on the file tree.

Final Report: Reviewing the AI-generated architecture suggestions for a Flutter project.
