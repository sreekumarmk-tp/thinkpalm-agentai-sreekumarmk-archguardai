        "Engineering teams still spend disproportionate time onboarding to unfamiliar "
        "repositories and judging architectural risk. Single-shot LLM prompts cannot "
        "reliably span an entire codebase, and shallow linting misses cross-cutting "
        "concerns such as security posture, performance characteristics, and structural "
        "maintainability. ArchGuard AI addresses this gap with a production-oriented, "
        "multi-agent workflow that behaves more like a disciplined review council than "
        "a one-off chat completion: specialists gather evidence from the live repository, "
        "score domains numerically, and a synthesizer turns those signals into a "
        "prioritized engineering roadmap."

        "repository tree, selectively read files for evidence, then emit structured "
        "markdown findings. A unified LLM adapter routes calls to OpenRouter or Groq based "
        "on model naming and configuration, with dynamic discovery of available models "
        "from each provider. Runtime resilience combines per-model retries, backoff, "
        "and ordered fallback chains so transient rate limits or provider errors do not "
        "halt the entire review."
